# SHUTL
## CM1101 Group Project

A small text based game built using python. The game has a
basic text parser that allows players to input commands
in simple english. The game controller then interprets these
commands and performs the appropriate actions.

To play the game please download the project folder. Once the
folder has been downloaded, navigate to the command shell.
Navigate into the project folder using the ``` cd ``` command.
Then simply run ``` python game.py ```
